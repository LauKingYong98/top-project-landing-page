# top-project-landing-page
The Odin Project's Foundations - Flexbox. 
This project is to create an entire web page using flexbox.  

Check out the website on https://laukingyong98.github.io/top-project-landing-page/

### Notes
I decide to use a character in a pokemon game (pokemon shield) that I play recently as the contents for the project. <br>
The page consists of 3 main contents (summary of character, character's pokemon team and my favourite quote of the character in the game)

### To Do List
1. Make contents viewable on small screen.
2. Update contents for pokemon team to be more specific (including pokemon's type, ability, move type etc) by using flexbox.
3. Add credit for pictures used and references for paragraph used.
